# What is Pints?

PINTS (Probabilistic Inference on Noisy Time-Series) is a framework for optimisation and Bayesian inference on ODE models of noisy time-series, such as arise in electrochemistry and cardiac electrophysiology.

PINTS is described in [this publication in JORS](http://doi.org/10.5334/jors.252), and can be cited using the information given in our [CITATION file](https://github.com/pints-team/pints/blob/main/CITATION).
More information about PINTS papers can be found in the [papers directory](https://github.com/pints-team/pints/tree/main/papers).


## Using PINTS

PINTS can work with any model that implements the [pints.ForwardModel](http://pints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core_classes_and_methods.html#forward-model) interface.
This has just two methods:

```
n_parameters() --> Returns the dimension of the parameter space.

simulate(parameters, times) --> Returns a vector of model evaluations at
                                the given times, using the given parameters
```

Experimental data sets in PINTS are defined simply as lists (or arrays) of `times` and corresponding experimental `values`.
If you have this kind of data, and if [your model (or model wrapper)](https://github.com/pints-team/pints/blob/main/examples/stats/custom-model.ipynb) implements the two methods above, then you are ready to start using PINTS to infer parameter values using [optimisation](https://github.com/pints-team/pints/blob/main/examples/optimisation/first-example.ipynb) or [sampling](https://github.com/pints-team/pints/blob/main/examples/sampling/first-example.ipynb).

A brief example is shown below:

_(Right)_ Example code for an optimisation problem.
The full code can be [viewed here](https://github.com/pints-team/pints/blob/main/examples/sampling/readme-example.ipynb) but a friendlier, more elaborate, introduction can be found on the [examples page](https://github.com/pints-team/pints/blob/main/examples/README.md).

A graphical overview of the methods included in PINTS can be [viewed here](https://pints-team.github.io/pints-methods-overview/).

### Examples and documentation

PINTS comes with a number of [detailed examples](https://github.com/pints-team/pints/blob/main/examples/README.md), hosted here on github.
In addition, there is a [full API documentation](http://pints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), hosted on readthedocs.io.


## Installing PINTS

The latest release of PINTS can be installed without downloading (cloning) the git repository, by opening a console and typing

```
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install pints
```

Note that you'll need Python 3.6 or newer.

If you prefer to have the latest cutting-edge version, you can instead install from the repository, by typing

```
$ git clone https://github.com/pints-team/pints.git
$ cd pints
$ pip install -e .[dev,docs]
```

To uninstall again, type:

```
$ pip uninstall pints
```


## What's new in this version of PINTS?
